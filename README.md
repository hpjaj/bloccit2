## Bloccit:  

Bloccit is a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc.io](http://bloc.io)

You can visit Bloccit live at: http://harrylevine-bloccit2.herokuapp.com/

As a developer, here's how you can test drive the application:

- [Git clone](https://github.com/hpjaj/bloccit2.git) the repository
- Run `$ bundle`
- Migrate and seed the SQLite3 databases (`rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed`)
- Start the server, `$ rails s`, and browse to `localhost:3000` 
- Sign up for an account
  - Create, edit and delete posts
  - Comment on other posts
  - Add images 
  - Vote on other posts
- To run the feature specs, call `$ rspec` from the command line
